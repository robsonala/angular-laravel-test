## Creation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

## Use of npx

We typically make use of [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to avoid globally installing the angular CLI project (
and others) globally as we work across a couple of versions internally.

If you install angular CLI globally, you can make use of `ng ...` commands, otherwise, switch out the `ng` below
for `npx ng ...` instead.

## Bootstrap

The project includes bootstrap added a a project dependency. Use of it is optional.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
